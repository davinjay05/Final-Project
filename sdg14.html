            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p> The SDG 14 aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification. 
                Enhancing conservation and the sustainable use of ocean-based resources through international law
                will also help mitigate some of the challenges facing our oceans.
            </p>
            <p> The world's oceans: their temperature, chemistry, currents and life drive global systems that make the Earth habitable for humankind.
                 How we manage this vital resource is essential for humanity as a whole, 
                and to counterbalance the effects of climate change. 
            </p>
            <h2> The Problems of SDG 14</h2>
            <p> The SDG 14 has its own Problems, mostly by Marine Pollutions where oceans are heavily polluted with plastics,
             chemicals, and other waste, which harms marine life and ecosystems. Secondly, It also cause a problems by Climate Change 
             That can led to Rising sea temperatures and changing ocean currents impact marine ecosystems. Leading to coral bleaching and the loss of biodiversity. </p>
             <p>OverFishing is one of the main Problems that can face animals live under water more danger. Overfishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean wildlife and biodiversity. 
             Loss of marine life brings a further threat to the millions of people who rely on seafood for protein and livelihoods. It comes from catching too many fish at once. So the breeding population becomes too depleted to recover.
              Overfishing often goes hand in hand with wasteful types of commercial fishing that haul in massive amounts of unwanted fish or other animals, which are then discarded.</p>
