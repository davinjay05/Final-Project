        Around the world, one million plastic bottles are purchased every minute, while up to five trillion plastic bags are used worldwide every year.
        In total, half of all plastic produced is designed for single-use purposes – used just once and then thrown away. There are about 75 to 199 million tons of plastic waste currently in our oceans, with a further 33 billion pounds of plastic entering the marine environment every single year.
        This constant flow of plastic production is simply too much for existing waste management and recycling infrastructure. The majority of animals that die are seabirds, with mammals often being more visible in the media but only accounting for about 100,000 deaths.
        What’s more, these are just the marine animals that die as a direct result of plastic debris in the ocean. It will cause the toll would be much higher if we kept doing this.

    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Our Goals</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">One of our primary goals of saving the ocean environment is to protect marine biodiversity. Oceans are home to a vast array of life, from coral reefs and fish to the larger species like whales and sharks. 
    Healthy marine ecosystems support the survival of these species, maintain balance in the food chain, and provide critical services such as oxygen production and climate regulation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">With OceanAction, we can help preserve these ecosystems, ensuring they continue to thrive and sustain both marine and human life.</p>
